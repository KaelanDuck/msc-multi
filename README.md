# MSC-Multi

USB Mass Storage Device Class implementation supporting read-only devices, disconnectable devices, error handling, and multiple-LUNs.

This project is intended to be a complete replacement for the libopencm3 implementation of the USB Mass Storage Device class, due to many deficiencies and a lack of support for multiple logical units.

I'll do documentation and examples later.
